It's time to create your character.
The first and one of the most important choices here is to choose a class.
Classes have a few differences in terms of skills they can learn and gear they can wear.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Brute Class:
    The Brute class specialises in dealing TONs OF DAMAGE at melee range with large
    2 handed weapons such as Mauls, Lances, Greatswords, Greataxes and Halbeards.
    They can wear Medium armour which offers a moderate amount of protection.
    Their skills focus purely on BIG DAMAGE (ON MY PING) trading any defensive
    or utility for that damage.
    
The Ranger Class:
    Opposite to the Brute, the ranger looks to do TONs OF DAMAGE from a bow OR daggers in a stealthy posistion
    being the second most flexible class, the ranger can use their deadly range or silent steaps
    to assassinate a target quickly and effectively.
    They can wear light armour that offers low defence in exchange for their highly supportive skills
    and passives that assist them in getting in and out without being seen, heard or smelt.
    
The Warrior Class:
    As the all-rounder, the warrior uses it's sword and shield to control the fight.
    Wearing heavy armour that offers a greater defence than others these fighters stand at the front of the fight.
    Their skills are a range of protection for themselves and their team, as well as offensive spells that increase
    their lethality to foes stupid enough to underestimate them.
    
The Wizard Class:
    The terrifying conjuerer of magic. The Wizard crushes all in their path with a range of deadly spells
    or protect allies with a collection of defencive and supportive buffs and spells that can turn the tide of battle.
    They wear robes that offer minimal protection, less than that of light armour.
    Their skills are replaced by their range of spells however learning a spell is far harder than learning a skill.
